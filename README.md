   - The ticket could involve an issue, request, or inquiry.
2. **Ticket Logging:**  
   - The help desk system logs the ticket with essential details like the userâ€™s contact information, issue description, and priority.
3. **Ticket Categorization:**  
   - The ticket is categorized based on the issue type (e.g., technical support, billing issue, service request) to route the ticket to the correct team.

### Step 2: Ticket Triage
1. **Ticket Prioritization:**  
   - The help desk assigns a priority to the ticket based on predefined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and issue severity.
   - Critical issues affecting major systems are given higher priority.
2. **Assigning the Ticket:**  
   - The ticket is assigned to the appropriate technician or support agent who has the necessary skills or access to address the issue.
3. **Initial Review:**  
   - The assigned technician reviews the ticket and assesses the severity of the issue to determine next steps.

### Step 3: Ticket Investigation & Resolution
1. **Diagnosis:**  
   - The technician investigates the issue to understand the root cause. This may involve troubleshooting or gathering additional information.
2. **Resolution & Fix:**  
   - Once the issue is identified, the technician provides a solution or fix, such as applying software patches or reconfiguring settings.
3. **Communication with the User:**  
   - The technician communicates with the user, informing them about progress and solutions or requesting more information if needed.

### Step 4: Ticket Testing (If Applicable)
1. **Verification:**  
   - After applying a solution, the technician verifies that the issue is resolved by testing and ensuring proper functionality.
2. **User Confirmation:**  
   - The technician may ask the user to confirm if the issue has been fully resolved to their satisfaction.
